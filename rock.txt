Welcome to the Jungle
3
We got fun and games
We got everything you want
Honey, we know the names
We are the Champions
4
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
The House of The Rising Sun
3
Oh mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
Candeeiro Encantado

La no sertao
Cabra macho nao ajoelha
Nem faz parelha
Com quem eh de traicao
Puxa o facao, risca o chao
Que sai centelha
Porque tem vez
Que so mesmo a lei do cao
In The End
4
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
Numb
5
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure
Of walking in your shoes
Lost in the Echo
6
You were that
Foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed
So taken
So conditioned I could never let go
Rocket
4
If you feel unclean, better bleach your body
If you're full of hate, better kill somebody
If you feel alone, better leave your body
If you wanna' leave, better build a rocket
Kingdom
6
Your wisdom
Your rule your kingdom
Trapped inside her
Show me some reason
I'll wake up, I'll need some answers
Silent curtain show me some reason
Apron Strings
8
It's all in a letter
All in a letter I wrote you down
Psycho in leather
Killer kid Clever leave this town
Is it any better Sunny weather
Teeth all brown
Kilowatt crystal under
and over and up and down
Eye of the Tiger
3
Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance now I'm back on my feet
Survivalism
5
I got my propaganda
I got revisionism
I got my violence in high def ultra-realism
All a part of this great nation
I got my fist I got my plan I got survivalism
