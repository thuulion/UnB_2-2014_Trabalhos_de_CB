Call Me Maybe

Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number
Poker Face

I wanna hold em'
Like they do in Texas
Plays old em' let em' hit me,
Raise it
Baby stay with me
Single Ladies

Cuz if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
The Mother We Share

Never took your side, never cursed your name
I keep my lips shut tight, until you go-o-oh
We've come as far as we’re ever gonna get
Until you realize, that you should go-o-oh
Dead Air

We hold up to an idea
And we’ll fight what we can’t see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going till we can’t hear
Gun

You had better run from me
With everything you own
Cause I am gonna come for you
With all that I have
Tether

Will we ever get away from this place
It's an image that's burned on my chest
For a moment you need me to stay
Cold blooded and drifting away
Night Sky

I will carry and give you life
I will cover you and show you the way
It's a sequence that you never learned
It's a lesson I will never forget
I can hear you in the overtones
Just an echo of the promise we made
Change the future, we can travel time
Or make us blind, so we can never look back
We'll be coming back
7
We took it all apart
But I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room something I heard you say
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away
But I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?
Habits
6
I ate my dinner in my bathtub
Then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous
If anything I'm restless
Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all
The Way That I Am
6
So you're proud to be a good one
But the good ones always complain
About the stuff they never did
Don't make a thing about the bad kind
'cause the bad kind don't even know
All the hearts they are messing with
This Time Around
5
I used to take your breath away
I used to make you laugh about anything
I used to be your getaway
Your getaway, our dream
I was everything you needed
